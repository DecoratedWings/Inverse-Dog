Ignore the Walk File, I was playing with something earlier

Any questions reach out to me. 

Arm and Leg are essentially the same thing constructed. 
Arm is the first limb, while leg is the second. 

Angles may be modified if necessary, but make sure the lengths and positions are kept the same,
so that you guys can see the two different legs clearly. 

In order to view the legs some text editors carry a preview html window.
If not, simply open the html file in your browser and you will see it move. 

The main files control the angles.
